# hello-world
GitHub made me do it

So, I am here to undestand how to program my own blockchain on Cosmos.
I would like to create an interconnected stock exchange for companies' producs and services.

Yeah, it is exactly what it sounds like, I have always found classic stocks and financial products particlarly boring because the access to these instruments is reserved for those who know how financial systems work.
My idea is to extend these financial possibilities to customers who love the products they are enjoying and would like to have a stake on what is create all aroud the world.

It's going to be a great journey.

Stay tuned
